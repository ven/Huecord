## Setup

1. Clone this repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/venoras/Huecord`

2. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.

3. Modify the `config.example.py` with the relevant parameters, and rename it to `config.py`.

    1. Go to [Discord Developers](https://discordapp.com/developers) and create a **New Application**. Navigate to **Bot**, and click **Add Bot**. Paste the **token** into the configuration file.

    2. To find your **Discord User ID**, right click your profile and click **Copy ID**. Developer Mode must be enabled in `Settings -> Appearance`. Paste this ID into `owner_id` in the configuration file.
